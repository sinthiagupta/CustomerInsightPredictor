# Introduction

In todayâ€™s competitive retail environment, understanding customer behavior and accurately forecasting sales are crucial. This project employs data-driven methodologies to segment customers and predict sales, ultimately helping businesses enhance their marketing effectiveness and improve resource allocation.

# Problem Statement

Retail businesses face challenges in identifying distinct customer segments for personalized marketing and predicting sales trends based on historical data. This project addresses these issues by applying machine learning techniques to enhance customer insights and sales forecasting.

# Methodology :
  # Data Collection: Utilize datasets containing customer information and sales history, such as the "Online Retail" dataset from UCI or Kaggle.
 
  # Data Preprocessing:
  Handle missing values through imputation or removal.
  Normalize numerical features to ensure consistency.
  Encode categorical variables using techniques like One-Hot Encoding.
  Data Visualization: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Model Creation:

Implement clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) for customer segmentation.
Use regression techniques (e.g., Linear Regression) to predict sales.

Model Testing:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for regression and accuracy for classification.


Data Collection
The dataset for this project can be obtained from:

UCI Machine Learning Repository - Online Retail Dataset
Kaggle - E-commerce Data
Data Preprocessing
Scripts for preprocessing the data can be found in the src/ directory, where missing values are handled, features are scaled, and categorical variables are encoded for modeling.

Model Creation and Testing
The model creation and evaluation scripts are also located in the src/ directory. Each model is trained on the processed dataset and tested against unseen data to ensure robustness.

Installation
To set up the project locally, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd Customer-Segmentation-Sales-Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the scripts for preprocessing and modeling, navigate to the src/ directory and execute:

bash
Copy code
python preprocessing.py
python model_selection.py
python train_models.py
python testing.py
